# Outcome Sync — Setup Guide

Drop-in addition to `close-first-sales-meeting`. Two new files, zero changes
to `update_field.py`:

```
close-first-sales-meeting/
├── outcome_sync.py                      # NEW
├── .github/workflows/outcome-sync.yml   # NEW
└── (everything else untouched)
```

## What it does every 30 minutes

For each **past** meeting in the last 7 days (excluded owners skipped):

1. **Already has a terminal outcome?** → skip. The script only ever writes when
   the outcome is blank or "Scheduled" — a rep's manual edit is never overwritten.
2. **Canceled in Close** (status or "Canceled:" title) → `Rescheduled` if a later
   booking exists on the lead, else `Cancelled`.
3. **Attention verdict** — reads "Todays Call Disposition (Opp)" (which Attention
   already writes) and maps it: New Call Show / Follow Up Show / Reschedule Show →
   `Completed`; the No Show variants → `No Show`; Canceled → `Cancelled`;
   Canceled - Rescheduled → `Rescheduled`. Guarded: only trusted when the meeting
   is the lead's most recent past meeting and ≤ 3 days old (it's a lead-level
   "today's" field, so it can only describe the latest call).
4. **Zoom attendance** — parses the Zoom meeting ID from the meeting's join link,
   pulls the participant report, matches the prospect by attendee email (fuzzy
   name match covers phone/renamed joins):
   - prospect on ≥ 5 min → `Completed`
   - prospect absent AND host on ≥ 10 min → `No Show` (listed as "auto no-show"
     in the report for review; disable entirely with `ZOOM_AUTO_NOSHOW=0`)
   - prospect on < 5 min, host barely present, or no Zoom data → **flag, no write**
5. **No signal** → left blank and flagged in the completeness report — this is the
   "every show gets logged" guarantee: flagged meetings print as review links
   (`https://app.close.com/lead/...`) in the Actions log and land in
   `outcome_sync_report.json` (uploaded as a workflow artifact).

Residual Google Meet meetings simply have no Zoom link → they resolve via
Attention or get flagged. No Meet integration needed while that tail shrinks.

## Setup steps

### 1. Create the Zoom Server-to-Server OAuth app (one-time, ~5 min)

1. [marketplace.zoom.us](https://marketplace.zoom.us) → **Develop → Build App →
   Server-to-Server OAuth** (must be created by a Zoom admin on the account that
   hosts the sales meetings).
2. Add scopes: `report:read:admin` and `meeting:read:admin`
   (granular equivalents: `report:read:list_meeting_participants:admin`,
   `meeting:read:past_meeting:admin`).
3. Activate the app, copy **Account ID / Client ID / Client Secret**.

> Requires a paid Zoom plan (reports API). The meetings must be hosted on this
> Zoom account for participant reports to exist.

### 2. Add repo secrets

GitHub → repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID` | from step 1 |
| `ZOOM_CLIENT_ID` | from step 1 |
| `ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET` | from step 1 |

(`CLOSE_API_KEY` already exists.)

### 3. Commit the two files, run in dry-run

The workflow ships with `DRY_RUN: "1"` — it logs every decision and writes
nothing. Trigger it manually (Actions → Meeting Outcome Sync → Run workflow) and
read the log. You want to sanity-check:

- SET lines look right (source + outcome match what you'd expect for those leads)
- auto no-shows are genuine no-shows (spot-check 3–5)
- FLAG list is small and explainable (mostly Google Meet residuals at first)

### 4. Go live

Edit one line in `outcome-sync.yml`: `DRY_RUN: "1"` → `"0"`. Done. To also
trigger via cron-job.org (like the field updater), point a second cron at the
`outcome-sync.yml` dispatch endpoint — or rely on the built-in schedule, which
is fine here since outcomes aren't as time-sensitive as FSCBD stamping.

## Tuning knobs (env in the workflow)

| Var | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `LOOKBACK_DAYS` | 7 | how far back to scan past meetings |
| `MIN_ATTEND_SECONDS` | 300 | prospect time to count as attended |
| `HOST_MIN_SECONDS` | 600 | host presence required before an auto No Show |
| `ZOOM_AUTO_NOSHOW` | 1 | set 0 to make Zoom absence always flag instead |

## Constants to keep in sync with update_field.py

- `EXCLUDED_OWNER_NAMES` (Stephen Olivas, Ahmad Bukhari)

That's the only shared constant — the sync deliberately doesn't classify titles,
because outcomes apply to every external meeting, not just first sales calls.

## Testing without touching anything

```
python outcome_sync.py --selftest   # 12 decision-logic tests, no network
```

## What this does NOT do (by design)

- Never overwrites a manually-set or terminal outcome.
- Never marks No Show from Zoom absence alone (host must have been present).
- Doesn't touch custom fields, FSCBD, or any existing field-updater behavior.
- Doesn't write outcomes on future meetings (they keep their Scheduled default).
