update_lane2_reassignment.py

Daily (weekday) round-robin reassignment of two Lane 2 lead buckets in Close CRM.

Buckets (driven by Close Smart Views, owner-filtered to Lane 1 reps):
  - Bucket 1  "L2 Handoff: 14-days No Comms"  -> Lane 2 Handraiser = "No Activity / Past 14 Days"
  - Bucket 2  "L2 Handoff: 30 Days since Booking" -> Lane 2 Handraiser = "30 Day Aged Deals"

For each lead pulled from a view, the script:
  1. Assigns the lead to the next Lane 2 rep in a round-robin rotation
     (each bucket keeps its OWN rotation pointer, persisted in lane2_state_cache.json).
  2. Sets the Lane 2 Handraiser custom field for that bucket.
  3. Reassigns every ACTIVE opportunity on the lead to the same rep (opp.user_id).
  4. Creates a HIGH-PRIORITY task for the rep, due today, with the bucket's text.

Why no churn / idempotency cache is needed:
  Both Smart Views are filtered to leads owned by Lane 1 reps. The moment a lead is
  reassigned to a Lane 2 rep it drops off the view, so it can't be picked up again.
  That makes re-runs on the same day safe (a second run finds the view already cleared)
  and means failed leads are simply retried on the next run.

Bucket precedence:
  Bucket 2 is processed FIRST. Any lead that somehow appears in both views is handled
  by Bucket 2 and skipped in Bucket 1. (By design the views shouldn't overlap.)

Modes (CLI flags or env vars set by the GitHub workflow):
  --dry-run   / DRY_RUN=true    Read + report only. No writes, no tasks. Shows the
                                exact round-robin distribution. Does NOT persist pointers.
  --skip-tasks/ SKIP_TASKS=true Do the field + opportunity updates, but create no tasks
                                (useful for backfilling without alerting reps).
