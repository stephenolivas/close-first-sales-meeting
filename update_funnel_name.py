update_funnel_name.py
=====================
Force the lead custom field **Funnel Name DEAL (Opp)** to "Reactivation Scrapers"
for every lead that was booked by a setter onto a Lane 1 rep's calendar.

Goal
----
Whenever a setter books a scraper "Next Steps" call, the lead's funnel name is
ALWAYS overwritten to "Reactivation Scrapers" — re-asserted on every run, with
no date cutoff. This is the aggressive/always-overwrite counterpart to the
write that `update_field.py` already does under a 2026-04-06 gate.

On each real flip (funnel was something else -> "Reactivation Scrapers"), a
high-priority Close review task is created for the lead's Lead Owner, due today,
naming the setter who booked the call ("New Reactivated Lead: Next Steps Call
Scheduled by <setter> - Please Review"). Follows the Lane 2 reassignment task
convention. Skipped (funnel still flips) if the lead has no Lead Owner.

Trigger (both conditions, by design — see REQUIRE_LIVE_MEETING)
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. The lead's "Reactivation - Setter Name" field is populated, AND
2. The lead currently has a meeting matching the scraper "Next Steps" pattern.

NOTE on the field:
  "Funnel Name DEAL (Opp)" is a SHARED custom field that IS defined on the LEAD
  object (confirmed in Close: Settings > Custom Fields > Leads). The "(Opp)" is
  only part of the display name. We therefore write it via the LEAD endpoint.

Conventions reused from the existing automations (verify against update_field.py
and update_lost_deals.py if you refactor to share helpers):
  - Reads:  GET  /lead/{id}/  -> custom fields come back keyed by DISPLAY NAME
            under lead["custom"].
  - Writes: PUT  /lead/{id}/  -> custom fields written keyed by API ID, prefixed
            with "custom." (e.g. {"custom.cf_xxx": "..."}).
  - The script verifies the write took before counting it as success.
